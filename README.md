# Better Bullets for Obsidian

Better Bullets is an Obsidian plugin that enhances the visual hierarchy and readability of your bullet points. It uses dynamic analysis to determine the depth of your lists and applies unique symbols, font sizes, and contextual formatting based on the content of your notes.

## Features

### 1. Hierarchical Bullet Symbols

The plugin automatically changes bullet symbols based on their relationship to other items in the list:

- **Grandparent (Level 2+):** Uses the `=>` symbol.
- **Parent (Level 1):** Uses the `->` symbol.
- **Leaf (Level 0):** Uses the standard `-` symbol.

### 2. Dynamic Text Formatting

Text is formatted based on its position in a list and specific syntax within the line:

- **Automatic Sizing:** "Parent" and "Grandparent" lines are scaled up based on your settings to create a clear visual outline.
- **Non-Leaf Bolding:** High-level list items can be automatically bolded to act as section headers.
- **Definitions:** Using the `Term | Definition` syntax bolds the term, highlights it, and italicizes the definition.
- **Notes:** Lines starting with `Note: ` are italicized, with the word "Note:" set to bold and italic.
- **Importance:** Lines ending with an exclamation mark `!` are colored and bolded.
- **Automatic Markings:**
    - **Years:** 4-digit years (e.g., 2024) are automatically underlined.
    - **Quotes:** Text inside `"quotes"` is italicized.
    - **Parentheses:** Text inside `(parentheses)` is italicized.

### 3. Settings

#### Hierarchy Configuration

Define the bullet symbol and CSS for each indentation level. Add or remove levels as needed using the **Add level +** and **Remove last -** buttons.

#### Formatting Rules

Create custom rules that match bullet text using regex patterns and apply CSS styles. Each rule supports:

- **Custom bullet symbol** — overrides the hierarchy symbol for matched bullets.
- **Custom bullet CSS** — overrides the hierarchy CSS for matched bullets.
- **Match mode** — either _Match full line_ (pattern must match the entire text) or _Match all_ (CSS is applied if the pattern matches anywhere in the text).
- **Patterns and styles** — one or more regex/CSS pairs; the first matching pattern's styles are applied.

Rules can be added, deleted, and reordered. Clicking **Reset to defaults** will prompt a confirmation dialog before overwriting all rules with the plugin defaults.
